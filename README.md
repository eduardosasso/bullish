Bullish is a **free daily email newsletter** with **information about the stock market**, including stock futures, premarket data, current and historical performance for major indexes like S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Jones.

The idea to build Bullish came from the need to have a quick, uncluttered overview of the market right before it opens, showing stock futures that signal if the market is trending up or down for the day and historical performance of the major indexes over time so I can decide if today is a day to  — Buy high and sell low —
